 We are the creators of beautiful smile. We help to give a new beautiful world to people out there. A noted proverb "You are never fully dressed without a smile" is really true.

This is heart wrenching story. I am sure it's going to be more heart wrenching because she is our peer, meaning one among us in this society. 

A busy day in OPD of Periodontics. As usual I was taking case history of patients along with senior. As the senior asked me to check the new file, it turned out that the diagnosis done by Oral Medicine and Radiology was that of AMELOGENESIS IMPERFECTA.

So, Amelogenesis imperfecta represents a group of HEREDITARY DEFECTS OF ENAMEL unassociated with any generalized defect. So basically it affects during formation of the outer layer of enamel. Teeth affected can be discoloured and prone to damage. There maybe pits seen on the teeth. Few cases are of HYPOCALCIFICATION type which can have teeth to be of smaller sizes and discoloured teeth. So this was a case of HYPOCALCIFICATION TYPE.

As usual, being in UG, I got excited that I got to see a rare case of hereditary origin. I was really excited to see how the teeth look.. how does the patient present? And all.....

Finally the patient arrives and I start taking case history. Basically questioning her about her troubles. She suddenly broke down in middle of case history. I was surprised and more pained to see that. She had a lot of pain in her. She began suddenly to say "I feel why am I even alive"....That is a big statement... 

So I calmed her down and asked her to say how it all started...  This was really painful to hear .. because I am also a girl of same age as her and I could relate to her feelings more than anyone else... and as I could understand what she was going through it became even more painful to me...

She had these small pearl sized teeth from her childhood. She used to get cornered from her childhood because of these small teeth. She was never included in anything and left alone even during lunch times in school. She told me this too... which angers me more... I just went on to question in my mind.. because this puzzles me how INHUMANE the society is... The mathematics teacher when she was in 10th even told her not to ask her any doubts... and the very sight of her makes him go pale an feels like his skin is going to rip apart... HOW RUDE?

Fortunately, she completed her 12th and went on to pursue B.com degree. Her school life was traumatized. She thought atleast her college life would be encouraging. She was accompanied by her friend to go to college everyday as it was 1 hour from her hometown.

The college life too turned out to be traumatizing. Her friend who was accompanying her started to feel "disgusted" and left her alone. Again during lunch breaks none of them came near her. She was going through the same mental trauma again. She discontinued her course and started to work in garment shop. Presently she has plans to stop going to garment shop as the same "DRAMA" has begun there too.  

And after saying all this story she in her exact words: "Please give me nice teeth so I can go out comfortably and please do it as fast as possible and I am soo done with all this and I feel why am I alive?". 

I still remember these words because they shook me altogether. I could see the real mental trauma anyone can through because of BULLYING. I am glad that she dint take any severe steps to end altogether but came for a treatment. I consoled her.. gave her real good advise.. told her woman should stay strong and looks don't affect the success.. and that SHE SHOULD CONTINUE GOING BACK TO COLLEGE because EDUCATION is everything to woman. She agreed with me and I was glad she got courage to fight these "BULLIES".

There are many people who suffer out there in the society who gets bullied because of her looks. What surprised me was that teacher too behaved that way. Is it called being inhumane or bullying a minor girl or both? A famous quote of Sanskrit says "‡§Æ‡§æ‡§§‡•É ‡§¶‡•á‡§µ‡•ã ‡§≠‡§µ‡•§‡§™‡§ø‡§§‡•É ‡§¶‡•á‡§µ‡•ã ‡§≠‡§µ‡•§‡§Ü‡§ö‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§Ø ‡§¶‡•á‡§µ‡•ã ‡§≠‡§µ‡•§‡§Ö‡§§‡§ø‡§•‡§ø ‡§¶‡•á‡§µ‡•ã ‡§≠‡§µ‡••"which translates to treat your mother, father, teacher and guest as gods. Is this how "God" as teacher would behave? What is wrong with this man? How inhumane he utters those world infront of a 15 yr old girl who is yet to build her life in this world? I never imagined the society would be this inhumane. Sadly, no one stood with her, supported her emotionally when she needed the most in peer society. 

The fortunate of all this story is her mother still supports herüòÅ without degrading her daughter and her father would still like to send her to college to study, which is really amazingüòÉ. Her brother still accepts her as his sisterüòÑ. What is traumatizing for me to see is though the girl is blessed with everything around her right from her parent's support and her will to study, the BULLIES present in this society has indirectly and directly affected her to destroy her life.



The advise is please ... please don't be a BULLY. Please never bully even if he is your ENEMY. My sincere request.. because it will have a huge impact on mental health sooner or later... and as all knows "KARMA IS BOOMERANG":)

I would like to add some beautiful quotes I collected...

"The more you love yourself, the less you tolerate."

"Even if you feel like you are alone, don't throw yourself."

The advise to give her from my side is don't pay heeds to BARKING DOGS.. you will never achieve success in life. And love yourself. This is easier said than done because when something takes a toll on your mental health it's really difficult to get rid of.



Until the next story, bii from Miss Molarüêá.
